NAME
    selfvars - Provide $self and @args variables for OO programs

SYNOPSIS
        package MyClass;

        ### Import $self and @args into your package:
        use selfvars;

        ### Or name the variables explicitly:
        # use selfvars -self => 'self', -args => 'args';

        ### Write the constructor as usual:
        sub new {
            return bless({}, shift);
        }

        ### Use $self in place of $_[0]:
        sub foo {
            $self->{foo};
        }

        ### Use @args in place of @_[1..$#_]:
        sub set {
            my ($foo, $bar) = @args;
            $self->{foo} = $foo;
            $self->{bar} = $bar;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This moudles adds $self and @args keywords to your Perl OO module.

    They are really just handy helpers to get rid of:

        my $self = shift;

    Behind the scenes, $self is simply tied to $_[0], and @args to
    @_[1..$#_]. Note that they are variables, not barewords.

    Currently, both $self and @args are read-only; this means you cannot
    mutate them:

        $self = 'foo';              # error
        my $foo = shift @args;      # error

    This restriction may be lifted at a later version of this module, or
    turned into a configurable option instead.

INTERFACE
    $self
        Return the current object.

    @args
        Return the argument list.

  Choosing non-default names
    You can choose alternative variable names with explicit import
    arguments:

        # Use $this and @opts instead of $self and @args:
        use selfvars -self => 'this', -args => 'opts';

        # Use $this but leave @args alone:
        use selfvars -self => 'this', -args;

        # Use @opts but leave $self alone:
        use selfvars -args => 'opts', -self;

    You may also omit a variable name from the explicit import arguments:

        # Import $self but not @args:
        use selfvars -self => 'self';

        # Same as the above:
        use selfvars -self;

DEPENDENCIES
    None.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This module was inspired and based on Kang-min Liu (gugod)'s "self.pm".

    As seen on #perl:

        <gugod> audreyt: selfvars.pm looks exactly like what I want self.pm to be in the beginning
        <gugod> audreyt: but I can't sort out the last BEGIN{} block like you did.
        <gugod> audreyt: that's a great job :D
