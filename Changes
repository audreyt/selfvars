[Changes for 0.20 - 2010-11-23]

* Added %hopts for ($self, key => value) styled calls:

    package Foo;
    use selfvars;
    sub meth {
        $self->{x} = $hopts{x};
    }

    # Call it like this:
    $foo->meth(x => 4);

* LICENSING CHANGE: This compilation and all individual files in it
  are now under the nullary CC0 1.0 Universal terms:

  To the extent possible under law, 唐鳳 has waived all copyright and
  related or neighboring rights to selfvars.

* Update minimum Perl version from 5.004 to 5.005 as required by Module::Install.

[Changes for 0.10 - 2007-12-29]

* Add support for %opts, an alias for named arguments in %{$_[1]}:

    package Foo;
    use selfvars;
    sub meth {
        $self->{x} = $opts{x};
    }

    # Call it like this:
    $foo->meth({x => 4});

* Support for omitting the "undef" part in selective imports:

    # Import $self and %opts but not @args
    use selfvars -self, -opts;
